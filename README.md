# NBA-Best
Playing with data to see who is the best NBA Player of all time.


Was working on learning some basics with Numpy and Pandas.  Found a dataset on Kaggle for NBA Player stats from 1950-2017. Created my own scoring formula to rank players.  

This measures players offensive, defensive, negative, and total impact for every minute played.  This rules out intangibles like number of MVP titles or number of championships won.

Description of scoring model is inside the notebook.
